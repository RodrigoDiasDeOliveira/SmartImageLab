Directory Structure
terraform/ Contains all (must have, if added, and here!!) the files necessary to manage the infrastructure in Oracle Cloud using Terraform. Here are the file descriptions:

main.tf: Contains the main infrastructure resources, such as virtual machine instances, storage buckets, and any other services required in Oracle Cloud.
variables.tf: Defines the variables you will use in the infrastructure resources.
outputs.tf: Defines output values that can be used in other modules or to display information, such as public IPs or service URLs.
terraform.tfvars: File for environment-specific variables (such as credentials or local configurations), usually ignored in public repositories to ensure security. (LOL)
src/ The src/ folder contains the project source code, including Python classes for image processing and interaction with the OpenAI API and Oracle Cloud.

init.py: Marks the src directory as a Python package. It may contain initializations of necessary packages.
main.py: The entry point of the application. It can manage the execution and integration of different modules. The execution of the image classification and identification process can (and should) be orchestrated here.
image_processor.py: Contains functions and classes responsible for processing the images before sending them to the classification or identification services (e.g., resizing, filtering, normalization).
image_classifier.py: Implements the logic for classifying images, which may involve using OpenAI AI models or AI services hosted in Oracle Cloud.
image_identifier.py: Responsible for identifying objects in images, likely interacting with image recognition APIs (e.g., OpenAI or other trained models).
image_storage.py: Manages the storage of images, whether locally or in storage solutions in Oracle Cloud (e.g., OCI Object Storage).
image_logger.py: Logs the processing and results of classifications/identifications, useful for auditing and debugging.
config.yaml: A configuration file that stores execution parameters (such as API keys, model parameters, Oracle Cloud URLs). This file must be (or should be) kept secure (not shared in public repositories).
README.md This file provides documentation for the project, explaining its purpose, how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and how to run the project. It's also there for me to remember how I thought of doing it.

Improvement Suggestions (to implement without disrupting the project idea)
Modularization: Break larger Python files into smaller modules as the project grows. For example, each type of image processing (such as "resizing", "edge detection", etc.) can be moved to a separate file or class.
Automated Testing: Add unit tests for each Python module, using a framework like unittest or pytest. This will help ensure the functions are working as expected.
CI/CD Pipeline: Since you're using Oracle Cloud, set up pipelines in GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automate testing and deployment processes.
Dependency Versioning: Discuss whether to use and/or create a requirements.txt or Pipfile to manage project dependencies.
Security: Ensure that all credentials, such as OpenAI or Oracle Cloud API keys, are protected using environment variables or other secure methods (and not included directly in code or files like config.yaml). Contributors should not store their keys in the git file or during pushes. (DumbAss!)
